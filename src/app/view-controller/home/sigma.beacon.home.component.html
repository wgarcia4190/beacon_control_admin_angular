  <h1>Welcome to BeaconControl!</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">This is the place where you’ll manage your beacon infrastructure and configure actions triggered in your mobile applications.
    Why don’t you start by adding some beacons? Then you can create your first application, add actions and start monitoring
    your beacons’ usage.</p>

        <h2>NEW BEACON</h2>
        <p>Adding the beacon is fast and easy. Recognize your beacon with UUID, and the major and minor numbers provided by
          its supplier, and then locate your beacon on the map. Now you're ready to setup actions for it, test it on BeaconControl
          mobile application and use in further development.</p>

        <h2>NEW ZONE</h2>
        <p>Link your beacons into zones to create an extended range for your beacon deployment. Extended ranges create an area
          in which specified zone actions are triggered, improving the efficiency of beacon management and mapping. Use this
          feature to magnify the effect of single beacons.</p>

        <h2>NEW APPLICATION</h2>
        <p>Our iOS test application is a good start but you'll want to connect your own at the end. Use automatically generated
          keynumbers to match your setup with your mobile applications. You can also embed our opensource SDK for iOS to
          speed up your project development.</p>
